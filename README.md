- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rolypoly74800
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m trying to create a batch script to automate a lot of the scripts for the XBox one kernal exploit and improve it's user friendliness.
- I appreciate the help and currently am on the Xbox-Scene discord @rolypoly, my intentions are not to steal any code or files.
- This is my first project and there are some files here that belong to others and I will try my best to credit them.
- Ultimately I wish to have a zip file that beginners download and run a batch menu to do what is needed.
